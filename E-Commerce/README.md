# E-Commerce

## How to open, compile, and run:
1. Open the downloaded repository.
2. Open the Dev-C++ project by opening E-Commerce.dev file.
3. Compile can be done by using F9 or F12, however F12 is preferrable to ensure that changes are actually written to the compiled program.
4. You can also use F12 then F11 to Compile (with Rebuild; via F12) and Run (Through Compile and Run; via F11).

## Rationale
This application is C++ implementation of an E-Commerce platform what would allow the sale 
and purchase of items from two different user types which are **Buyer** and **Seller**.

## Reminder
For the sake of coding simplicity, the application was designed and written with the user inputs 
being valid all the time. However, some precautionary coding was already implemented on most parts of the program.

## Components
1. main.cpp
2. structs.h
3. interface.h

## Other files
Other files shown such as the .dev, .layout, and .win files are artifacts created by Dev-C++.

## IDE and Compiler Used
The software application was created and tested using Dev-C++ 5.11 using TDM-GCC 4.9.2 64bit Release.
